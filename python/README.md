# Python

## Testing

To run the tests in the source code, simply invoke the script using following command in your console:

    python main.py

This assumes that *python* has been defined as an environment variable.  For more information, please visit the official [website] [1].  If you don't have access to that now, try an online interpreter, such as [Try Python] [5] or [Python Anywhere] [4].

## Inspiration

My initial interest in learning Python quickly turned into a love of the language, thanks to the original [Python Tutorial] [2] by [Guido van Rossum] [3], the author of the language.  Most of the examples here are inspired by the those in that tutorial, although it has since been updated for every new release, and is particularly different for version 3 of the language.
