# Python

## Testing

Using the following Just command to run these Python tests:

```sh
just python
```

These examples are written for Python version 3 only.  For more information, please visit the [official website].
If you don't have access to that now, try an online interpreter, such as [Try Python] or [Python Anywhere].

## Inspiration

My initial interest in learning Python quickly turned into a love of the language,
thanks to the original [Python Tutorial] by [Guido van Rossum], the author of the language.
Most of the examples here are inspired by the those in that tutorial,
although it has since been updated for every new release,
and is particularly different for version 3 of the language.
