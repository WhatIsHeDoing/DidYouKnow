# JavaScript

## Testing

These tests are simply by run by opening `didyouknow.html` in a browser!  The page references [QUnit][QUnit] to run the tests within `javascript.js`.

## Code Quality
The following code quality tools are applied via their respective rules files:

* [JSHint][JSHint]: from `.jshintrc`.
* [JSCS][JSCS]: from `.jscsrc`.

## Inspiration

Although many of the tests are assembled from memory and as I stumble across them, I have the following sites to thank for furthering my knowledge:
