Testing
-------

These tests are easiest run by opening the solution - `charp.sln` - within Visual Studio.  They reside in `csharp\Main.cs` and can be run in the application from the menu:

`Test => Run => All Tests`

This solution was created in Microsoft Visual Studio 2012 Professional, but can be opened with the free [Microsoft Visual Studio Express 2012 for Windows Desktop] [1].

Although many of the examples here will be assembled from memory and as I stumble across them, I have the following sites to thank for furthering my knowledge:
