# Perl

## Testing

To run the tests in the source code, simply invoke the script using following command in your console:

    perl main.t

This assumes that *perl* has been defined as an environment variable, and possibly that some extra libraries are installed from [CPAN] [1].  For more information, please visit the official [website] [2].  If you don't have access to that now, try an online interpreter, such as [Compile Online] [3].


## Inspiration

All the examples are from personal experience with the language and existing scripts.  The documentation from the official [site] [2] and the [CPAN] [1] modules often provide excellent explanations and usage instructions.
