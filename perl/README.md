# Perl

## Testing

To run the tests in the source code, simply invoke the script using following command in your console:

```sh
perl main.t
```

This assumes that *perl* has been defined as an environment variable, and possibly that some extra libraries are installed from [CPAN].
For more information, please visit the official [Perl] website.  If you don't have access to that now, try an online interpreter, such as [Compile Online].

## Inspiration

All the examples are from personal experience with the language and existing scripts.
The documentation from the [Perl] site and [CPAN] modules often provide excellent explanations and usage instructions.
