# C++

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/WhatIsHeDoing/DidYouKnow.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/WhatIsHeDoing/DidYouKnow)

## Testing

Compile the test program using:

``` sh
make main
```

... and run it with:

```sh
./main
```

This assumes a Linux console (try [Cygwin] on Windows) with *make* and *g++* installed.
If you don't have access to that now, try an online compiler, such as [Coliru] or [compilr].

## Inspiration

Relative to other languages I have used, C++ easily throws up the most WTFs,
mainly due to its sheer size and backwards-compatibility with C.
The majority of the features here have been learnt from working with existing code,
but many have been adapted from the following aggregate resources:

- Evan Wallace: [Obscure C++ Features]
- Stack Overflow: [Hidden Features of C++?]
- Stack Overflow: [What are some of the more obscure parts of C++?]

As ever, Wikipedia has been invaluable when looking for detailed descriptions of each feature,
and often throws up more interesting lessons in the process!
