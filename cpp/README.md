# C++

## Testing

Compile the test program using:

    make main

... and run it with:

    ./main

This assumes a Linux console (try [Cygwin] [1] on Windows) with *make* and *g++* installed.  If you don't have access to that now, try an online compiler, such as [Coliru] [2] or [compilr] [3].

## Inspiration

Relative to other languages I have used, C++ easily throws up the most WTFs, mainly due to its sheer size and backwards-compatibility with C.  The majority of the features here have been learnt from working with existing code, but many have been adapted from the following aggregate resources:

 * Evan Wallace: [Obscure C++ Features] [6]
 * Stack Overflow: [Hidden Features of C++?] [4]
 * Stack Overflow: [What are some of the more obscure parts of C++?] [5]

As ever, [Wikipedia] [7] has been invaluable when looking for detailled descriptions of each feature, and often throws up more interesting lessons in the process!
